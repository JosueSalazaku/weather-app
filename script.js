/** TODO:
In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER:
Use an api to define the city geo-location data from the user-input
Use an api to get the weather data for at least the next 5 days
Manipulate your DOM in order to display the weather for the next 5 days in your application.
Find a way to make those API calls asynchronous.
The application must be responsive, accessible and mobile friendly
ðŸ’¡ Not sure where to start? Split this features into multiple smaller todos (in your code, sketch, ...)

TODO:
Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as Chart.js
Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
Allow the user to compare the weather in two cities
Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form */
